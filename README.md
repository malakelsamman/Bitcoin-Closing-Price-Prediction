# Bitcoin-Closing-Price-Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the closing price of Bitcoin in the stock market using machine learning models. The dataset includes historical data of Bitcoin prices along with other variables like open, high, low, and volume.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and scaled numerical features.
2. **Data Analysis**: Explored the dataset and found a linear relationship between variables.
3. **Linear Regression Model**: Trained a linear regression model achieving high accuracy.
4. **LSTM Model**: Initially, the LSTM model was trained using only the target value. For future work, the plan is to incorporate other independent variables as input to improve prediction accuracy.
   
## Conclusion
- Linear regression showed strong predictive power due to the linear relationship between variables.
- LSTM model's performance was evaluated to see if it outperformed linear regression.

## Future Work
- Experiment with other machine learning algorithms.
- Incorporate additional features for better predictions, such as using all independent variables as input for the LSTM model.
